# MLB_Stats Project Description

## Project Introduction
Project Creator: Alex Verdin

Github: https://github.com/averdin2/MLB_Stats

This project is a self made project for educational purposes only. The project will be using data from MLB Data API located at https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/.
The goal of this project is to create a working website that allows users to go through Major League Baseball team's stats in an organized manner.
This project will be developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. API information is in JSON format.

Currently, the stats displayed are for the 2019 season. Once the 2020 season starts, I will update this project to reflect those stats.
